LINE NUMBER IN dalys.py:  
Line 46

RESULT DISCUSSION:  
The results show that only Rwanda had DALYs exceeding 650,000 in 1994. 
This is expected due to large populations, which likely contribute significantly to both mortality and morbidity. 
The data highlights how DALYs are influenced not only by the prevalence of diseases but also by population size.
