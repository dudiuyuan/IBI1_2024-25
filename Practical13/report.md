#The length of the human SOD2 protein: 222

#The subcellular localisation of the human SOD2 protein: Mitochondrion matrix

#The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results: 58.1% ~ 100%

#The alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids for each of the three comparisons that you performed using Python: 

    Human-Mouse Alignment:
    BLOSUM62 Score: 1097.0
    Percentage Identity: 90.1%

    Human-Random Alignment:
    BLOSUM62 Score: -207.0
    Percentage Identity: 5.9%

    Mouse-Random Alignment:
    BLOSUM62 Score: -228.0
    Percentage Identity: 5.0% 

#A statement recording which of these two sequences are most closely related: The comparison scores and percentage identity of SOD2 between humans and mice are significantly higher than those of random sequences, indicating a close evolutionary relationship between the two.

#P.S. I used "scoring_matrices" library in Python for the BLOSUM62 matrix. 

#I found the instructions online and followed the steps. 

#And I tested the BLOSUM62 Score using small sequences and got the same results as hand-calculating. That's working!
