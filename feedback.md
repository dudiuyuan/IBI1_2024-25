#In the formative feedback, the overall mark is 97.1, which indicates that there are still some areas that need improvement.

#I received 13/13 in Week 3 and 14/14 in Week 5. While the feedback of Week 5 stated that "a few spelling issues (“datas”, “nessasary”, “TypeScrip”) and an awkward phrase (“elif bye”) that could confuse", I corrected my spelling mistake and made pseudocode clearer as changing "elif bye" to "elif the language is not in the dictionary, print that the language is not in the dictionary"

#I received 21/23 in Week 4. The feedback pointed out that "The structure works well, but comments could better explain the purpose of b = n + b." about triangle.py and "some phrases are unclear or misleading (e.g., "add 1 to the variable"). Consider rephrasing to explicitly mention iterations and clarify the purpose of the loop." about mystery_code.py.

##Therefore, I explained "b=n+b" by "# Add the current value of n to b and update b" and "# This accumulates the sum of b with the current loop index n".
And I also added "# Increase n by 1 and move to the next loop iteration" to help "n=n+1" make sense.

##Meanwhile, I rewrited the Answers in mystery_code.py with a clearer and more precise emphasis on iterations and the loop’s purpose.
